Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project II: bikeshare data  

## Overview

In this project, I will be exploring bikeshare data for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington Using Python.  I will write a code that will help in answering some question a user may want to. I am called to provide a script that will take raw data as input and output some answer using the help of descriptive statistics in the terminal window.   

## Tool needed to accomplish the task

To accomplish the project, I will be using:
Python: for programming
Notepad++ as a text editor 
And a terminal window (provided by Udacity Platform)

## The Datasets

The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:
Start Time 
End Time 
Trip Duration 
Start Station 
End Station 
User Type
